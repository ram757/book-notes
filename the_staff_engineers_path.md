# The Staff Engineer's Path - Book Notes

## Introduction

- Two paths: take on direct reports and become a **Manager** or become a technical leader without reports, a **Staff Engineer**

##### Pillars of Staff Engineering

These pillars support your impact.

- **Big-picture thinking**: Step back and take broader view. Think beyond immediate details and current time; Build software that is easy to decommission; Predict what your company needs in 3 yrs
- **Execution**: Projects are messier & ambigious. Need more ppl, political capital, influence, etc
- **Leveling up**: Intentional influence through teaching/mentoring. Be role model and lift up those around you

Frame problems so that other people care about them - put them in perspective. Act like a leader whether you feel like one or not.

## Chapter 1

**What's expected of you; What are staff engineers for?**

- **Titles matter**: (https://oreil.ly/oUkHe): Help people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, communicating an expected competency level to outside world
- **Big Picture**: Gathering context takes time/effort. Need engineers who see through a wider lens (goals of multiple teams or org)
- **The Staff Eng** Ensures resulting systems robust, fit in tech landscape of company, cautious about tech debt, wary of future maintenance traps. Piece together long-term strategy while solving today's problems
- **Staff === Leader** - Set example for engineering practices that other engineers follow
  - Accomplishing larger things means working with larger groups of people - requires more skills than just technical work. Grow skills of those around you
  - Take on ambiguous/messy problem.. once it is tractable, becomes growth opportunity for less experienced engineer (staff eng provides support)
- **Goals of Org** - Find ways to stay connected to your org's goals; skip-level manager meetings, 1/1s across teams
- **Scope too broad** (too many teams?):
  - Lack of impact: if anything can be your problem, everything can become your problem - side quests w/ no real goal
  - Becoming a bottleneck: too many people depend on you
  - Decision fatigue: Cost of deciding which things to do
  - Missing relationships: hard to build relationships when working across too many teams
- **Scope too narrow** (single team?)
  - Lack of impact: spend more time on something that doesn't need that expertise
  - Opportunity cost: Pigeonholed and not top of mind to solve problem elsewhere in org
  - Overshadowing other engs: take learning opportunities away from them
  - Overengineering: overengineered solution for straightforward problem... prob shoulda been assigned harder problem
- **Questions to ask yourself**:
  - Depth vs breadth approach?
    - Breadth: influence tech direction of org & broader view
    - Depth: Industry expert in particular domain
- Which of the **4 disciplines do you gravitate toward**? More senior = more fluidity across
  - Core technical skills, Product Management, Project management, People management
  - Staff eng use All of these
  - Find balance within team if you hate a particular aspect
- **Coding balance**: The broader the decision-making the more likely to be further from code...
- **Feedback**: have check-ins with manager to get honest feedback on how things are going
- **Staff Archetypes**:
  - Tech Leads - guide execution of one or more teams
  - Architects - technical direction/quality across critical area
  - Solvers - one difficult problem at a time
  - Right hands - Add leadership to org
- **Be deliberate**: Every time you choose what to work on, you're also choosing what not to work on
- **Importance**: Know why your work is strategically important; if it's not... do something else. Staff eng work needs to be important
- **Scope Alignment**: Write out your understanding of your job and share it with your manager :) align your understanding
- **Right enough**: Don't obsess about getting things perfect, get it RIGHT ENOUGH...
- **Your job**: Senior ppl do a lot that's not in their core job description; if the projects needs it to be successful, you should do it

## Chapter 2

**Context: your work, your org, what are your goals?**

- **Locator Map** - _You are here_ - Build the map to see where you are, what's outside of your view, borders. Purpose of your org, customers, ppl relationships
- **Topographical Map** - \*the terrain\*\* - How to navigate where you're going. Are there paths in place? Create your own? Friection/gaps between teams.
- **Treasure Map** - \*where you're going\*\* - The vision/strategy to get where you're going. What stops may be along the journey....Everyone knows where they're going
- **Pay attention!** - Train your brain to remember facts you may or may not need later. Fill in details of your map
  - All hands meetings, skip-level 1/1s, facetime with customers
  - If you don't understand your customer, you don't have perspective on what's important
- **Perspective** - Put your work in bigger context - see it from other ppl or team's perspectives. Broaden view.
- **Focus risks** - Focus = depth/understanding but...
  - Prioritizing badly - Problems outside the team are still important!
  - Losing empathy - don't overfocus and forget the rest of the world.
  - Tuning out background noise - You want to still be attentive of what's going on around you
  - Forgetting what the work is for - don't forget why you're doing what you're doing!
- **Outsider view** - As staff eng, should try to have "new to team" perspective all the time!
- **Peers** - Seeking out peers in other groups is important part of the job! and important for career progression
- Solve problems, that doesn't mean you need to write code to solve them
- **Rough terrain** - pitfalls when on your mission without detailing your terrain
  - Your ideas don't get traction - Need to convince others why you're right and why they should care
  - Don't find out about difficult parts until later - Gain upfront undestanding, what others have done, what has failed before, why...
  - Things take longer than expected - Know your org else decisions that seem straightforward could take long time
- **Staff+ in org** - You should be fairly autonomous/self-directed but ensure org agrees... does your manager need to dictate your focus? Understand what is typical in org
- **Communication** - Gain friends across teams - if one can chat w/ coutnerpart in another group, easier to make decisions across teams
- **Hierarchy** - Success depends on having access to opportunities/sponsorship; Understand your place in hierarchy and know when project will come and take you to next lvl
- **Western classified orgs**
  - Pathological - low-cooperation, people out for themselves, personal glory
  - Bureaucratic - rule-oriented, standard chain of command, change difficult
  - Generative - Mission-oriented, high-trust, high-coop
  - High trust cultures w/ info flow === better software delivery performance
  - Encourage coop cross-funct teams, learn from blameless retros, encourage experiments, calculated risks, break silos!
- **Navigating** - Understanding your org's culture gives you idea of how easy/difficult journey will be
  - Chasms - watch out for communication/decision/dispute traps between teams
  - Fortresses - Teams/individuals seemingly out to stope you; gatekeepers... they gatekeep because they care; learn to work with them
  - Disputed territory - Work spanning multiple teams with vague ownership - get group alignment
- **Technical correctness** - Being technically correct is only the start; need to convince THE RIGHT PEOPLE too
- **In the loop** - if you're feeling out of the loop consistently, you don't udnerstand _how_ decisions are made and who influences them. You need to be insider in that group! Ask someone you trust to help figure out where decision came from.
  - Get in group to impact your org (don't say it's for you personally lol)
  - You need to add value to room to reduce cost of including you!
- **Shadows** - Sometimes folks that are pivotal to decision making could just be long-timers... a stray from the org. Gain understanding of this
- **Get in the know**
  - Anouncement lists & channels... walk the floor and read what's going on... lurk on slack channels... check in with leadership & skip lelels, talk to people!
- **The ppl problem** - Problems that slow down tech orgs usually human ones. Teams don't know how to talk to each other. Build bridges. Preemptively build bridges if possible!
- **Short-term problem** - Think short term it'll be harder to get everyone in same direction, hard to finish big things, accumulate tech debt, competiing initiatives...
- **The goal** - Life easier when everyone knows where they are going. Get the goal, and step back to analyze if proposed work will get you closer to it. Once you understand it, don't keep it to yourself! Give clear defn of success so everyone can aim for it
- **Look back** - Should have narrative of what you're aiming to achieve and how it went. Did you accomplish it!?
- **Look forward** - What are you trying to do, how does current work contribute to it?
